# Network-Clock (NC)

## Connexion

This code has been tested on Ubuntu. \
To start it, you need to open two terminals (on PowerShell), one for the server and one for the client.

### Server

``python3 .\main.py``

### Client

``telnet <ip> 1234``

## Packages

All of those packages are needed to run the code :
 - os (OS)
 - sys (System)
 - arrow (Date and time)
 - socket (Socket)
 - subprocess (Run commands)
 - select (for non-blocking sockets)
 - threading (for multi-threading)
 - json (JSON)
 - hashlib (Hashing)
 - prctl (Process control for Linux)
 - jsonschema (JSON Schema validation)
 - ctypes (Ctypes)

## Commands

### Server-side

 - v - to toggle verbose mode (less/more output)
 - c - to change server's time
 - q - to quit
 - t - to get the time
 - h - to get help

### Client-side

- c - to change the time format
- q - to quit
- t - to get the time
- h - to get help

#### About arrow

Arrow is way more efficient than datetime, it's also more secure. \
Used multiple scan tools such as Snyk and Bandit to check for vulnerabilities. \
Arrow is also more efficient in terms of code, it's way more readable and easier to use.
